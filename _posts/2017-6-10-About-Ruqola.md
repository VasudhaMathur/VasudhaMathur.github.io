## Ruqola, WikiToLearn, KDE

[Ruqola](https://github.com/WikiToLearn/Ruqola) is a Qt interface to Rocket.Chat, with a library implementing DDP semantics, and a QML UI for both desktop and 
mobile phones. 
The application is a QML/C++/Qt app, thus providing multi-platform portability. Currently there is no native Rocket.Chat 
client; Ruqola will be the first generic chat application based on Rocket.Chat.

This project will consist in designing and developing a chat application for WikiToLearn. 
New features such as adding notification support through the whole application, creating a more complex model for messages 
(e.g. support for reactions, images, and advanced features), network management, adding OAuth/federated login support for 
both desktop and mobile app will be implemented.
